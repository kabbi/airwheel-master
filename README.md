Airwheel Master
---------------

An attempt to make airwheel self-balancing scooter controller app and device emulater as a nice desktop application with terminal ui.

Using `blessed`, `react-blessed`, `redux`, `redux-saga`, `noble` and `bleno`.

**Warning:** all the airwheel-related code is for educational purpose only. I don't think it's legal to reverse-engineer car bluetooth protocol, so I'm leaving all the legal issues for the user of this app. I am not using it and / or expecting to use this code for any commercial purposes.
